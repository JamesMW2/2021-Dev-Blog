Hello there. S.S.D. or sercet service drones. Is a three man group inculding myself. Our end goal is to get this drone to fly in a course.
Today we connected to the drone and sent commands (and it got stuck in the celing) using UDP which stands for user data protocol. UDP  is a means of sending packets to and from devices.
