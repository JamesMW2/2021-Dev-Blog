Hello There, So today I've been tasked with asking, "What is Frontend Devleopment?"
Front-end web development is the practice of converting data to a graphical interface, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,

We've been working on a pin board project with Java, while I didnt get around to finishing it. I was able to take one big thing away. Im rusty, things made sense when I used the guide but when I went to do it on my own it didnt click.
Hopefully I'll keep it pushing and improve.
