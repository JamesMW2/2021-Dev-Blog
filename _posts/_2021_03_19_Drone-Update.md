## The Task(s)
Hello there! We've been working on the backend drone project for a good minute now. The goal I might add is to make it fly in a timed "race" 
## the progress so far
We've got a good chunk of code written. But thats only basic commands. take a peek: ![exsample]({{site.url}}/assests/code.png)
This isnt all of it. but it shows off the "emergencyCommand" which took longer to prepare


## fun bits
