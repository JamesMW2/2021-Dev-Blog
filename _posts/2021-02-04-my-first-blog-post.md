Hello there, my name is James and I'm a student in coding. I've created this blog to track progress (its also a grade so)

GOALS
I hope to improve my skills and grow in this class.
I am still unsure of what I want to do, but I know I want to be able to work alone and then come together in a group to report.
GitHub
I've been using GitHub for ahwile as an outside user, never really using it for anything outside of downloading content/patching a game.
It looks really confusing but after about 10 minutes Ive got it down well. Pretty easy stuff.
